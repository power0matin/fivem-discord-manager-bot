# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue (token leak, auth bypass, etc.), please **do not** open a public issue.
Instead, contact the maintainer privately and rotate the affected tokens immediately.

## Basics

- Never commit `.env` or any secrets.
- Rotate Discord/Twitch/Kick tokens if you suspect a leak.
